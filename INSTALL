           How to Install the mLAG SW package
           ==================================

This document describes how to build, install and run mLAG on a
Linux host. This procedure was successfully performed
on the following environment :

    - Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server release 6.2 (Santiago)

Build Requirements
------------------

To compile the user-space programs in the mLAG distribution,
you will need the following software:

    - GNU make.

    - The GNU C compiler. We used gcc version 4.4.6
	
    - GNU Autoconf version 2.63 or later.

    - GNU Automake version 1.11 or later.


Installation Requirements
-------------------------

The machine on which mLAG process is to run must have the
following libraries:

    - libc compatible with the libc used for build.
	
    - libdl
	
    - libpthread
	
Install script
-------------------------

To simplify installation, a script named install_mlag.sh is provided.
The script fetches the required	repositories and builds the mlag libraries 
and binaries.
If you choose to run the script, you may skip to 'Running the mLAG process'
section below and continue from there.

Pre-fetched repositories
------------------------

The mLAG SW package relies on the use of the open source SW listed below :

    - FSM-tool
	
        This was used for FSM implementation within mLAG code.
        Available at https://github.com/evgenyi1/FSM-tool 
	
    - OES (Open Ethernet switch API)
	
        Available at https://github.com/open-ethernet/OES
	
    - MLNX-LIBS
	
        A set of infrastructure libraries by Mellanox Technologies Ltd.
        Available at https://github.com/Mellanox/mlnx_lib
	
    - mLAG
	
        mLAG protocol SW components, contained in the same git
        which includes this file.
	

Building and Installing mLAG
----------------------------

First, make sure you have all the required repositories, organized as follows:

    /home
        mlag
        FSM-tool
        OES
        mlnx_lib
            sx-complib
            libctrllearn
            libeventdisp
            libcommu
			
Then do the following steps :

    1. Enter mlnx_lib directory and build libraries :
        1.1  run ./autogen.sh
        1.2  run ./configure --with-oes=$PWD/../OES
        1.3  cd into sx_complib 
        1.4  run ./autogen.sh
        1.5  run ./configure 
        1.6  run make && make install
        1.8  cd back to mlnx_lib directory
        1.9  run make && make install
		
    2. Enter FSM-tool directory and build libraries :
        2.1  run ./autogen.sh
        2.2  run ./configure 
        2.3  run make && make install
		
    3. Enter OES directory and build OES stub :
        3.1  cd OES
        3.2  run make && make install
		
    4. Enter mlag directory and build mlag executable :
        4.1  run ./autogen.sh
        4.2  run ./configure --with-sxcomplib=/usr/local/ --with-mlnx-lib=/usr/local/ --with-fsmlib=/usr/local/ 
             --with-oes=$PWD/../OES --with-oes-lib-path=/usr/local/lib/ --with-oes-lib-name=oesstub
             --with-ctrl-learn-hal-lib-path=/usr/local/lib/ --with-ctrl-learn-hal-lib-name=ctrllearnhalstub 
             --with-sl-lib-path=$PWD/src/libs/service_layer/.libs/ --with-sl-lib-name=servicelayer
	     --with-nl-lib-path=$PWD/src/libs/notification_layer/.libs/ --with-nl-lib-name=mlagnotify
        4.3  run make && make install

Running the mLAG process
------------------------

Once build is done, mLag process can run by just typing mlag in the command line.
In order to make configurations to the process one needs to create a c program that will
use the mLAG API library - libmlagapi.
